# Tests
- To test this run the following commands:
    - `go run main.go print` -> there should be no output since the block chain has not been created yet.
    - `go run main.go add -block "first block"` -> add the first block to the chain. Since it's the first block, by default the genesis block will be added.
    - `go run main.go print` -> running again the print command will output the `genesis` block plus the one created in the last step `first block`
    - `go run main.go add -block "send 10 BTC to Jackie"` -> adds a third block.
    - `go run main.go print` -> please see the output below to see how these 3 blocks would look like when calling the print command at this point:
        macbookpro@MBP-de-MacBook blockchain_poc % go run main.go print
